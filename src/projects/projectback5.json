It was unnecessary to use a robust backend to support a site that would consist of static content so I sought to find static site tooling that I can easily maintain. I also wanted to work with React and found React Static by Nozzle which made the adoption of React very seamless, as it used React and Webpack, which I was already implementing in my front-end workflow. I created a responsive logo and wordmark that I may use for print and web to promote the brand and platform, as well deliver a consistent and professional look, that conveyed my eagerness to get started on working on projects and the impact that I can make. I utilized SVG Animation to animate the logo and supporting assets on the site with responsive design in mind. I was able to tap into the core features of React to seamlessly implement the front end of the site and add my created assets"]

The current supported logo, was in need of refactor, and my first iteration to the site required a different approach that utilized Wordpress's features, as well as make it adoptable by other interested clients, or allow the client to scale his own in the future. I went about strategizing how content may be organized, easily edited, and updated, and what required dynamic elements.  planned how to best use the Youtube API, and implement communication between the site and the Twitch API endpoint for realtime status updates and chat accessibility.I also needed to recreate the brand and add a professional look to the channel host that would assist in generating a larger audience. I added Ad Space to the theme to in turn to generate revenue and in turn help keep the site active as users visited the site. Search Engine Optimization techniques were applied to further extend the reach for the site."]

This involved first stategizing and establishing the core features necessary to meet the user criteria. I also had to methodically plan out user flow, by mapping out user stories, and establishing how to keep the experience simple and direct so that any user may install the app and get to fulfilling the task they sought out to do as seamless as possible. I also wanted to make sure users of the app can extend interest of using the app to other users. Scaling for future features of the app also had to be placed under consideration when planning how the user interface should work to prevent for updates extending the functionality of the app would not result in breaking other features. Another tenant of the project scope involved establishing how the app would be experienced by two different types of users. Users would need to query information about other users based on certain criteria, as well create and edit spar request forms sent to other others users. With these ideas in mind I planned out an optimal database strucutre necessary to delivery content to the UI. I decided to utilize Firebase to handle realtime data store as well as user authentication. Necessary image assets also had to be designed as well to support the user interface, so I went about creating a brand with supported typography, and color scheme that would suit the user interface."]
